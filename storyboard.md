DMV QUEST!
User enters DMV (it sucks) to update registration
TWO LINES! - left line, 3 people (old) 
           - right line, like 10 people (young and sassy?)

IF LEFT LINE: Half hour passes, old people can't hear, closes for lunch. Either keep waiting, or go to RIGHT line.

- IF STAY: Given number for another window, to the waiting area! Old guy offers you drink from flask? Either escape to bathroom, or get crunk.
    - IF BATHROOM: get trapped in stall. you die.
    - IF CRUNK: Lunch passes fast, it's lit. Number is called, everything is fine.
- IF RIGHT: Start RIGHT line

IF RIGHT LINE: Trainee is doing work, no promise on work quality. Either keep waiting, or go to LEFT line.
- IF STAY: 10 minutes. Sassy kids making tik-taks, T. Swift shit. They ask you to hold phone. Yes or no? 
    - IF YES: Drop the phone, it breaks. Security tries to kick you out. You can argue or leave
        - IF ARGUE: Kicked out anyway. You die of depression.
        - IF LEAVE: Turns out you can do this online. You wasted your life.
    - IF NO: Eventually reach counter. Trainee can't help you, go to left line. Should have from the start, idiot.
- IF LEFT: start LEFT line
